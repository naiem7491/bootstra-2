              Inspired by contemporary, Scandinavian design, these modern slat panels are loved by interior designers and homeowners alike. As a feature wall in your living room, or a statement ceiling feature, these panels can instantly elevate

            <h3>The UK's original out-of-the-box slat wall panelling solution</h3>
            <p>Innovation is at our core, as is listening to our clients. They wanted modern wood panelling that was quick to install, and we listened. <br>
            Using over 50 years of wood knowledge and expertise, in 2017 we developed the first DIY, wood slat wall panelling solution in the UK. Our simple, yet easy to install wall and ceiling panel was born, and is available today in a range of finishes, to continually upgrade spaces with quality wood textures with ease.

            <h3>Outstanding, class-A acoustic properties</h3>
            <p>The panels not only deliver a visually eye-catching wall covering solution, but also bring the added benefit of efficient sound absorption. <br>
              Creating an effective home studio, or cinema room is simple. Install the panels onto wooden battens, to improve the acoustic properties of the panels, and achieve class-A sound absorption.
